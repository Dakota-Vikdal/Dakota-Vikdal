### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Dakota Vikdal

Hello, my name is Dakota Vikdal, I'm currently delving deep into the skill called Software Engineering. I have made great strides and am excited to see where this skillset will take me. My training has been in Python, Flask, Javascript, and React with an emphasis on Python. I graduated from Flatiron School in May of 2023 as a Full Stack developer and decided I wanted to get to know Python more. So I spent the next months studying up on Python, developing scripts, learning how to scrape data, convert images, work with pdf files, send emails from Python, and much more. It was a long and enriching road. After learning all of that I found that what I really want to do in the software development space is web development. I want to build websites that are rich with content and interactivity. This is my path for the forseeable future. Thanks for reading!
