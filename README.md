### Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is Dakota Vikdal

Nice to meet you! This Readme is a little bit about me. Currently I'm delving deep into the skill called Software Engineering. I have made great strides and am excited to see where this skillset will take me. My training has been in Python, Flask, Javascript, and React with an emphasis on Python. I graduated from Flatiron School in May of 2023 as a Full Stack developer and decided I wanted to get to know more about Python. I spent the next months studying up on Python, developing scripts, learning how to scrape data, convert images, work with pdf files, send emails from Python, and much more; it was a long and enriching road. After immersing myself in Python, I discovered that my true interest lies in the realm of web development. I want to build websites that are rich with content and interactivity. This is my path for the forseeable future. Thanks for reading!
