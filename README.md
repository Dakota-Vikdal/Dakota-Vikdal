### Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is Dakota Vikdal

Nice to meet you! This Readme is a little bit about me. I am a Software Engineering who has been trained in Javascript, React, Python, and Flask as well as SQL, SQLAlchemy, and Flask-SQLAlchemy. I graduated from Flatiron School in May of 2023 as a Full Stack developer and decided I wanted to delve even deeper into the field of Software Engineering. Ever since graduating I have consistently worked on deepening my knowledge of the languages, libraries and frameworks that I know. After delving into script writing for a while, I discovered that my true interest lies in the realm of web development. I want to build websites that are rich with content and interactivity. This is my path for the forseeable future. Thanks for reading!  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing my web development skills with React as my primary tool.
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to develop web applications that are brilliant and useful.
  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything pertaining to Javascript, React, Python and Flask! The more we ask, the more we know.

- ðŸ“„ Here is my resume for you perusal: file:///C:/Users/Dakot/OneDrive/Desktop/Resumes/New%20Resume.pdf

- âš¡A fun fact about me: I love both fitness and videogames, which I think is a great balance.
